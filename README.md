One of my first projects in Web Development from three years ago.

Meant to be a website with landing page for my father's construction company.

Built using plain old HTML, CSS and JS, this was meant to be a completely static site with content co-existing with code inside the html files.

Did not reach the point of "How do I host this" since I was still learning VS Code live server.

I don't have any plans of continuining the project in this repository, but keeping this around to mark the beginning of my journey.
