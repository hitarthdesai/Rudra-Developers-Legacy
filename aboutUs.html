        About Rudra Developers
    <p class="companyIntro">Rudra Developers was established by the joint efforts of Mr. Kirtikumar Sampatrai Desai and his son, Mr. Jainulbhai Kirtikumar Desai, in the year 2001. This company was established with the purpose of not only developing and selling land, but constructing basic infrastructural properties along with the land, thereby ensuring that the buyers are satisfied with the deal. Under the wide experience of Mr. Kirtibhai and technical expertise of Mr. Jainulbhai, the company pulled off landmark projects like Palihill, etc which stand proudly to this day in and around the Southern part of Gujarat. The most significant changes over its parent company, Kirti Developers, was that now, all infrastructural facilities like roads, compound walls, over-head water tanks, water supply lines, road-side rain water drain lines and plantation, street lights and supply of eletricity will be taken care of by the company itself and not other third party contractors, thereby ensuring optimal quality in the work.
